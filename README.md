# TwilioHackathon2020
I have baked up a solution written Node that allows the ability to 
give your name and phone number, recieive a confirmation notification, then 
call the subscriber into a custom conference room.

The .env file has been ignored as of course, so listed below are a few of your required setting to get this application up and running for yourself.

Enjoy!
